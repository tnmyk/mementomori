          >It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot
          of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has
          been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well
          invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no
          good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to
          realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it
          is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not
          ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use
          it.</q
